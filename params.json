These technologies allow us to describe all variants in a genome and international collaborative efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have begun to catalogue and release data on genomic variation in a variety of cancer types.\r\n\r\nHowever, such datasets pose new challenges in the way the data have to be analyzed, annotated and interpreted which are not trivial and are daunting to the wet-lab biologist. This course covers state-of-the-art and best-practice tools for the analysis of cancer genomes. We describe, and give hands-on experience of, the entire analysis workflow from raw data generated by a sequencing machine to deriving variant calls (SNVs, copy-number and structural variants) that are ready for downstream analysis and interpretation\r\n\r\n# Instructors\r\n\r\n- [Mark Dunning](https://github.com/markdunning)\r\n- [Andy Lynch](http://www.andrewlynch.co.uk/)\r\n- [Geoff Macintyre](http://gmacintyre.com/)\r\n- [Oscar Rueda](http://www.cambridgecancercentre.org.uk/users/oscarrueda)\r\n\r\nWe are very grateful for the support of the [Bioinformatics Training](http://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/about) facility at the University of Cambridge\r\n\r\n# Aims\r\n\r\n- Appreciation of the nature and scale of NGS data and the requirement for sophisticated computational methods\r\n- Describe theory behind current methods for calling SNVs and copy-number changes from NGS data, and their outputs\r\n- Encourage exploration of NGS data using interactive tools such the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)\r\n- Increase awareness of existing cancer cohorts and how they can be exploited\r\n\r\n# Objectives\r\n\r\n- Understand the main file formats used for NGS analysis (bam, vcf, bed etc), what is included in each file and appropriate tools for manipulating each file\r\n- Know the metrics and tools that can be used to assess if a given sequencing run is adequate quality for analysis\r\n- Understand the concepts and challenges involved in calling SNVs from whole-genome data\r\n- Given a set of called SNVs, be able to \r\n    i) assess quantitively and qualitatively which calls might be \"real\" or not \r\n    ii) assess which calls might be biologically-meaningful and warrant further investigation\r\n- Know how to access TCGA and ICGC data and how they can inform other studies\r\n\r\n\r\n# Venue\r\n- Craik-Marshall room, Department of Genetics\r\n\r\n# Accommodation\r\nIf required, free bed and breakfast accommodation wll be provided for attendees in Downing College - close to the course's location. Please let us know on the registration form if you need accommodation and when you plan to check-in and check-out.\r\n\r\n# Timetable\r\n\r\n## Day One 09:30 - 17:00\r\n\r\n09:30 - 10:30 Course Introductions\r\n\r\n10:30 - 12:30 R recap - Mark\r\n\r\n*12:30 - 13:30 LUNCH (provided)*\r\n\r\n13:30 - 15:30 Understanding raw sequencing reads\r\n\r\n15:00 - 17:00 Understanding aligned reads \r\n\r\n## Day Two 09:30 - 17:00\r\n\r\n09:30 - 10:30 SNV Introduction and calling germline SNVs (Lecture)\r\n\r\n10:30 - 12:30 Calling germline variants and working with VCF files\r\n\r\n*12:30 - 13:30 LUNCH (provided)*\r\n\r\n13:30 - 15:00 Copy-Number analysis (Lecture)\r\n\r\n15:00 - 17:00 Copy-Number analysis (Prac)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Day Three 09:30 - 17:00\r\n\r\n09:30 - 10:00 Somatic SNV calling (Lecture) \r\n\r\n10:00 - 12:00 Calling and inspecting Somatic SNVs \r\n\r\n12:00 - 12:30 Filtering SNVs (Lecture) \r\n\r\n*12:30 - 13:30 LUNCH (provided)*\r\n\r\n13:30 - 15:00 Annotating and Prioritising SNVs \r\n\r\n15:00 - 15:30 Further issues and considerations \r\n\r\n15:30 - 17:00 Visualising genomic data with R and Bioconductor\r\n\r\n\r\n## Day Four 09:30 - 17:00\r\n\r\n- Calling Structural Variants\r\n- Interpreting and visualising SV calls\r\n- Filtering a set of variant calls\r\n- Identifying events such as chromothripsis\r\n- WORKSHOP DINNER\r\n\r\n## Day Five (1/2 day) 09:30 - 12:30\r\n\r\n-  Dealing with large collections of Genomes\r\n-  Obtaining TCGA data\r\n-  Mutational signatures\r\n-  Integrating different data types# Social Events\r\n\r\nThe workshop dinner will be held in Christ's College on Day Four; dress code is smart casual.
